## About Project

## Installation
The technologies used include CSS, HTML and JavaScript. First of all, an array of questions was created. Event listeners were used to start the quiz when the user clicked the start button. The timer function would also start as soon as the quiz appeared. The following function was used to rotate through all the questions and answer options in the array:
